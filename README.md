Searchify is a Django extension for binding together Django models and search
engine systems. Right now it's almost completely undocumented, with reasonable
support for ElasticSearch, early days support for restpose but limited to 
zero support for anything else. Over time this will change.

Yes, I know about Haystack; I'm aiming for this to be better for what I need.
Hopefully it will help others as well.
